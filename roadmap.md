# Roadmap

## Skeleton Work

  * Basic componentization of existing widgets for continued use in Perseus Scaife plus new Scaife instances.
  * Main grid including widgets (especially for things like app crit, commentaries, word list, syntax trees
  * Parallel independent reading (lots of potential implications for navigation, behaviour of widgets, etc)

## Repository / Ingestion Pipeline (for current Perseus Scaife)

See repository tickets

## Perseus Scaife Hygiene and Quality of Life

  * Sentry bugs
  * User-reported bugs
  * Search performance

## Independent Library

  * Better cognitive and product management encapsulation
  * Work with ATLAS servers
  * Components to share with vocab.perseus.org and within reader
  * More metadata on authors and works
  * Visualisations and stats about the corpus
  * More visibility into workflow and state
  * DTS Collections API story?

## Basic ATLAS-driven Reader

### Phase 1

  * ATLAS server with hierarchical text parts of single text (individual Homer work, Beowulf, individual Apostolic Fathers work, Enchiridion, something in English?)
  * Ancestors, Children, Passage Reference, Text Size, Text Width
  * Pagination

### Possible Phase 2 Directions

  * Multiple work support
  * Text part zooming, text part extension (a la Read Beowulf)
  * Add selection support with:
      * API call
      * Use of Inline annotation (just displayed in widget for now)

### Possible Phase 3 Directions

  * Inline display of annotations:
      * Interlinear
      * Colour-coded
  * Translation alignment
  * Syntax Trees
      * relationships in widget
      * relationships with inline colour-coding
      * drawing trees
  * Search in ATLAS world (including cylleneus)

## Specific Project Needs

  * Custom TOCs
  * App crit
  * Fascimile Images
  * Repository pipeline improvements
  * Library improvemetns
  * Search improvments
  * Translation alignment
  * Syntax trees
