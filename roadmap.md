# Roadmap

## Skeleton Work

  * Basic componentization of existing widgets for continued use in Perseus Scaife plus new Scaife instances.
  * Main grid including widgets (especially for things like app crit, commentaries, word list, syntax trees
  * Parallel independent reading (lots of potential implications for navigation, behaviour of widgets, etc)

## Repository / Ingestion Pipeline (for current Perseus Scaife)

See repository tickets

## Perseus Scaife Hygiene and Quality of Life

  * Sentry bugs
  * User-reported bugs
  * Search performance

## Independent Library

Motivation: 

  * Better cognitive and product management encapsulation
  * Work with ATLAS servers
  * Components to share with vocab.perseus.org and within reader
  * More metadata on authors and works

### Possible Phase 3 Directions [IN PROGRESS]

  * Inline display of annotations: [IN PROGRESS]
      * Interlinear [IN PROGRESS]
      * Colour-coded
  * Translation alignment
  * Syntax Trees
      * relationships in widget
