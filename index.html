      <h1>The Scaife Viewer Project</h1>

      <p>
        The <b>Scaife Viewer</b> was originally designed as the first phase of
        work towards the next generation of the Perseus Digital Library. This
        work can be seen at
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <a href="https://scaife.perseus.org">scaife.perseus.org</a>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It is now growing into a highly extensible platform usable by a variety
        of different projects, with a growing library of widgets that integrate
        texts with various types of annotation and external APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to help Digital Humanities projects to focus less on
        building their own reading environments and more on the scholarship
        unique to their project. We hope soon to be able to showcase some of
        the projects being built on Scaife.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is part of the
        <a href="http://opengreekandlatin.org">Open Greek and Latin Project</a>,
        an international collaborative consortium of librarians and
        researchers, that includes the Center for Hellenic Studies of Harvard,
        the Harvard Library, the Library of the University of Virginia, Mount
        Allison University, the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts, and the Open
        Philology Project at the University of Leipzig.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at Leipzig
        funded the initial development but ongoing work is now funded by a
        variety of organisations both generally and in the context of specific
        Digital Humanities projects. Such organisations include the Mellon
        Foundation, Harvard University, Brill, and the Qatar National Library.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Scaife Viewer is named for
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Scaife">Ross Scaife</a>,
        a pioneer in digital classics who lived the virtues of collaboration
        and who set an early example in establishing open access and openly
        licensed data as the standards upon which Digital Classics now depends.
        The initial release of the Scaife Viewer was on March 15, 2018, the
        tenth anniversary of his premature passing on March 15, 2008.

      <h2>Scaife Development</h2>

      <p>
        While <a href="https://eldarion.com/digital-humanities/">Eldarion</a>
        continues to lead development, the goal is to create an
        ecosystem which members of the community can extend. The code is open
        source under an MIT license. The technologies used include Vue.js, GraphQL, Django,
        and Elastic Search.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The best way to get involved is to join Slack and get familiar with the key repositories
        and Trello boards.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Repositories</h3>

      <p>
        As well as making incremental changes to
        <a href="https://scaife.perseus.org">scaife.perseus.org</a>, we're also working
        on a new architecture with a separate server (called ATLAS, for
        Aligned Text and Linguistic Annotation Server) and a frontend consisting
        of a Skeleton and various pluggable Widgets. We are proving this architecture
        out with a couple of prototypes including "Explore Homer" which brings
        together various levels of analysis of Homer, and "SV Mini" which shows
        a variety of texts with some analysis but not as deep as Explore Homer
        nor as broad as the entire Perseus Digital Library.
