# Scaife Development

## Key Repositories

As well as making incremental changes to scaife.perseus.org, we're also working on a new architecture with a separate server (called ATLAS, for Aligned Text and Linguistic Annotation Server) and frontend consisting of a Skeleton and various pluggable Widgets. We are proving this architecture out with a couple of prototypes including "Explore Homer" which brings together various levels of analysis of Homer.
