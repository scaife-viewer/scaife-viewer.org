# Widget Inventory

**bold** indicates existing; _italics_ indicates being worked on

We are in the process of breaking widget code out from specific sites and putting them in [scaife-widgets](https://github.com/scaife-viewer/scaife-widgets).

  * Those that change which passage:

    * Generic to any hierarchical text:
        * **Ancestors**
        * **Children**
        * **Passage Reference** (including range support)

    * **Text Search** (intimately tied to search infrastructure)
    * _Library_ (see Independent Library)
    * _Custom TOC_ (Brill, reading lists, alternative chunking)

  * Those that give information on the passage:

    * Generic information:
        * **CTS URN**
        * _Work Metadata_ (including credits)
		
    * Export:
        * **Export Passage**

        * **Text Width**

    * Highlighting / Selection:
